            <p>Thanks for stopping by! By day, I'm a Content Strategist for a Bellevue-based online travel technology company, meticulously developing and optimizing content that helps customers around book travel as effortlessly as possible. By night, I'm a student in the <a class="cleanLink hover" href="https://bootcamp.uw.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington Coding Boot Camp</a> program. It's been a whirlwind experience so far, but I'm loving the challenge and couldn't be more excited for the opportunities that await me after completing the course. </p>
            <p>My professional experience can best be summarized as an intersection of standard copywriting, line editing, writing for the customer experience, and just a dash of journalism, for good measure. I plan to marry my existing content experience with newly acquired coding skills that empower me to build entire websites and apps from the ground up, covering as many aspects of the web development process as possible. </p>
            <p>In my free time, I consume as many books, concerts, and Netflix comedy specials as I can, and spend more time than I'd like to admit on YouTube. My true passion, however, is travel. I take several trips per year both near and far (sometimes at barely a moment's notice), but being a born-and-bred Washingtonian, I always look forward to finding my way back to the Pacific Northwest. </p>
